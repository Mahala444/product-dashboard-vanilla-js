This project is a Product Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches product data from a public API and displays the first five products on the page, each showing an image, name, and price. The JavaScript file (cp_2.js) demonstrates two approaches to asynchronous data fetching: one using .then() and .catch(), and another using async/await with try/catch for cleaner, modern syntax. The project includes a reusable error handling function (handleError) to log fetch errors clearly. The product cards are dynamically generated using DOM manipulation and styled with CSS to create a clean, responsive layout. Interactive hover effects such as scaling and shadows are applied using :hover and transition for a smooth user experience. This dashboard helps strengthen core JavaScript skills, particularly in handling APIs, updating the DOM, and writing clean, reusable code.
